                    ACME Company was founded in 2002 when three friends decided they wanted
                    to change the world for the better. They knew that a world without magic was too
                    plain and boring, and so they set out to make the world awesome. Even though they
                    knew creating magic was the hardest problem any of them have faced, it did not stop
                    them from making the impossible possible. 11 years into the process, and they
                    have nearly figured it out. It's this determination, persistence, and passion that
                    has led to their near-success of the creation of magic.
